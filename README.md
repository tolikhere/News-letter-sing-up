This challenge was completed by me from a course "The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy

By the course I should've used the Mailchimp API but in Russia it's not available so I have used our Russian analogue and so I did.
Though it was deferent from the Mailchimp, but I figured it out.

And my minus is here that I used hard coded params_id and id of group.I did'nt make it dynamic. But I'm sure there's plenty of more minuses haha.
